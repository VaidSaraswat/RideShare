This application is designed to allow users to post ride offerings from/to campus. The goal is to implement this application using the MERN stack. I used this project to learn about how to develop REST APIS, and also how to communicate with databases. Since I used the MERN stack, I learned about how to use ReactJs as the front-end alongside with Redux as a state management system. For the backend I used Node/Express, and in doing so learned how to create a REST API.
