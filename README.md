#RideShare
I have developed the backend of this full stack web application. This application is designed to allow users to post ride offerings
from/to campus. The goal is to implement this application using the MERN stack. I used this project to learn about how to develop REST APIS ,
and also how to communicate with databases. The frontend of this application will be completed soon.
